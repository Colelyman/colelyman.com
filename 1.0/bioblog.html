			<h2>Membranes Objective-2.4</h2>
			<p><img src="images/bio/membrane.gif" title="Phospholipid bilayer membrane (you will have to draw this)" height="120" width="400" />Image courtesy of <a href="http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/michael.gregory/files/bio%20101/bio%20101%20lectures/Biochemistry/phospholipid_bilayer.gif">http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/michael.gregory/files/bio%20101/bio%20101 %20lectures/Biochemistry/phospholipid_bilayer.gif</a></p>
			<p>This image represents the structure of a cellular membrane. This structure is called a phospholipid bilayer; phospholipid because the molecules have phosphorylated "heads" and fatty acid or lipid "tails", and there are two layers hence "bilyaer".</p>
			<h3>Unique Qualities of Phospholipids</h3>
			<p>This structure is unique/important because the phosphorylated heads are hydrophillic or "water loving" while the lipid tails are "water hating". This is why the tails face inwards and the heads face outwards, towards the water/environment. The reason the phosphorylated heads are hydrophillic is becuase they are polar and the lipid tails are hydrophobis because they are non-polar.</p>
			<h3>Structure of Individual Phospholipids</h3>
			<p><img src="images/bio/phospholipid.gif" title="The structure of a single phospholipid" height="300" width="275" />Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.biosynth.com/media/verschiedene/phosphatidate.gif">http://www.biosynth.com/media /verschiedene/phosphatidate.gif</a>. This image represents the construction of a single phospholipid. The phosphoralyated head and the fatty acid tails are connected together with a glycerol base.</p>
			<h3>Structure of the Complete Membrane</h3>
			<p>Imagine that the phospholipids are men in an army and they are being attacked from both sides. One unique thing about these army men is that they are extremely vulnerable in their backs so they have to stand together with their backs facing each other. In this analogy, the "army men" are the phospholipids and their fronts are the phosphorylated heads and their backs are the the fatty acid tails. The enemy of the "army men" is water, so the phophorylated heads are resistant to water but the fatty acid tails are not which is why the fatty acid tails face each other, to stay away from the water.</p>
			<p>There are not only phospholipids in the membrane, but there are also various types of proteins and cholestrol. The cholestrol is present by the fatty acid tails, and helps keep the membrane flexible and fluid. Note: plant cells don't have cholestrol in their membranes, they use saturated and unsaturated fatty acids instead.</p>
			<h3>Membrane Protein Functions</h3>
			<p>The general protein functions within a membrane are as follows:
			  <ul><li>hormone binding sites</li>
			    <li>enzyme action</li>
			    <li>cell adhesion</li>
			    <li>cell-to-cell communication</li>
			    <li>channels for passive transport</li>
			    <li>pumps for active transport</li></ul></p>
			<p>Horomone binding sites in cell membranes serve the purpose of recieving hormones from the environment and proceeding to change the shape of the protein and then deliver a message to the cell. The embedded enzymes in cell membranes help catalyze reactions on the interior and exterior of the cell. Cell adhesion is just cells attaching to their environment or other cells. The cell-to-cell communication is exactly what is seems. The communication that cells usually "say" to each other is mainly what type of cell they are. Channels for passive transport enable some substances through the cellular membrane that are either too large or not molcularly suited to pass through the cellular membrane independently. Active transport is for substances that have to move in and out of the cellular membrane in large numbers, quickly or against the concentration gradient.</p>
			<h3>Passive and Active Transport</h3>
			<p>Passive and active transport are the two main ways substances enter and exit a cell. Passive transportation does not require any energy (ATP) at all and active transportation requires energy (ATP). Energy is required for active transport because the substance is moved against the concentration gradient, meaning that there is more (comparitively) substance inside the cell than there is outside, but substance is still being moved in. In the aforementioned scenario if the substance were being moved with passive transportation, the substance would not move inside of the cell because there is more inside than outside, in other words the substance is not at equilibrium. 
			  

			<p class="post-info">Posted by <a href="index.html">Cole</a> | Filed under: Eukaryotic Cells, 2.3</p>

			<h2>Eukaryotic Cells Objective-2.3</h2>
			<p>Eukaryotic cells are what make up multicellular organisms like humans. You will need to be able to draw and label a eukaryotic cell. <img src="images/bio/euk.jpg" title="Eukaryotic (animal) cell labeled" height="350" width="350" /> Image courtesy of <a href="http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/animals/images/animalcellsfigure1.jpg">http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/animals/images/animalcellsfigure1.jpg</a>.</p>
			<h3>Organelles</h3>
			<p>Organelles are the various structures inside of an eukaryotic cell that perform various functions. You can think of organelles like the organs inside of your body. The common organelles found in eukaryotic cells are:
			  <ul>
			    <li>endoplasmic reticulum (ER)- there are actually two ERs in eukaryotic cells, rough and smooth. The difference is that the rough ER has attached ribosomes where as the smooth ER doesn't. Their function is transportation of various substances throughout the cell</li>
			    <li>ribosomes- this is where protein synthesis (specifically translation) occurs</li>
			    <li>lysosomes (usually not found in plants)- have a single membrane and transport enzymes</li>
			    <li>golgi apparatus- stores, packages and modifies proteins</li>
			    <li>mitochondria- energy synthesis (the site of cellular respiration)</li>
			    <li>nucleus- where most of the genetic material in the cell is located</li>
			    <li>chloroplasts (only in plant and algal cells)- the site where photosynthesis occurs</li>
			    <li>centrosomes (in every eukaryotic cell, but centrioles are not in some plant cells)- consists of a pair of centrioles and aids in cell division</li>
			    <li>vacuoles- used for storage and hydrolytic functions</li></ul></p>
			<h3>Cytoplasm</h3>
			<p>Every eukaryotic cell has a cytoplasmic region, which is inside of the cellular membrane and surronds the organelles. Cytoplasm mainly consists of water but may have some other nutrients. The region between organelles that is fluid is referred to as cytosol.</p>
			<h3>ER</h3>
			<p>The ER is basically the "subway system" of the cell. There are tubes or channels that usually originate around the nucleus but extend to most parts of the cell. The only difference between smooth ER and rough ER is that rough ER has ribosomes attached to the exterior. Why is the ER centralized around the nucleus and why would ribosomes be attached to the exterior? Well, nature likes to take the path of least resistence. In order for protein synthesis to occur mRNA must come out of the nucleus, and the mRNA must go to a ribosome for translation to occur. So right as the mRNA exits the nucleus it can be transported by the rough ER straight to a ribosome. Cool isn't it? (not). The smooth ER also has substances embedded into it, excpet they aren't ribosomes. The smooth ER has unique enzymes embedded into its surface. Some of the functions of these enzymes are:
			<ul><li>production of membrane phospholipids and cellular lipids</li>
			<li>production of sex hormones such as testosterone and oestrogen</li>
			<li>detoxification of drugs, mainly occurs in the liver</li>
			<li>storing calcium ions for contraction in muscle cells</li>
			<li>transports lipid based compounds</li>
			<li>aid the liver in releasing glucose into the bloodstream</li></ul></p>
			<h3>Ribosomes</h3>
			<p>Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis and have no exterior membrane. They may be found attached to the rough ER or free in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes are composed of RNA and a protein. Ribosomes have different sizes in different types of cells. The ribosomes in eukaryotic cells are larger and more dense than the ones in prokaryotic cells. The ribosomes in eukaryotic cells are said to be 80S (this is basically a size, the S stands for Svedberg units) and the ribosomes in prokaryotic cells are 70S. Ribosomes are composed of two subunits put together.</p>
			<h3>Lysosomes</h3>
			<p>Lysosomes are the "stomachs" of the cell. They digest various substances and come from the Golgi apparatus. They have one membrane and house upto 40 different enzymes inside of that membrane. They are also the "recyclying center of the cell", they digest and breakdown old or broken organelles and reuse the raw parts. The interior of the lysosome is acidic in order for the enzymes to hydrolyze large molecules.</p>
			<h3>Golgi Apparatus</h3>
			<p>The flattened sacs that make up the golgi apparatus are called cisternae. The cisternae are stacked on top of each other. The functions of this organelle are to collect, package, modify and distribute materials synthesized by the cell. On the Golgi apparatus there is a recieving side (you can think of it as a "loading dock") and a side where the completed proteins exit. The recieving side is called the cis side and is near the rough ER. The opposite side is called the trans side and this is the side where the completed proteins exit. The proteins exit in vesicles, which is basically a membrane surronding the protein. The proteins are surrounded by a membrane to prevent some of the proteins from reacting to the cytoplasm or other organelles.</p>
			<h3>Mitochondria</h3>
			<p>Mitochondria (or mitochondrion, singular) are the power houses of the cell. Mitochondria have a double membrane (this is important because of cellular respiration). The mitochondria is the location for cellular respiration. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which leads scientists to believe that they were once an independent bacteria that was very efficient at cellular respiration and were utilized (kind of like slaves) by eukaryotic cells to create ATP (bascially cellular energy). Inside of the double membrane of mitochondria there is a semi-fluid substance calle the matrix. The folds in the inner membrane are called crista. The inner membrane space is the name for the space between the two membranes. Mitochondria also produce their own 70S ribosomes, which supports the theory that they were once a bacteria.</p>
			<h3>Nucleus</h3>
			<p>Is where the DNA (and various other enzymes involved in transcription) reside. The nucleus has a double membrane that is called the nuclear membrane or nuclear envelope. There are various pores in the nuclear membrane that allow various molecules and substances passage in ant out of the nucleus. In eukaryotes DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones, these histones help keep DNA organized. A nucleosome is DNA wrapped around 8 histones with a ninth to secure it. A chromosome is a whole bunch of nucleosomes put together. Some eukaryotic cells have no nucleus or have multiple nuclei. </p>
			<h3>Chloroplasts</h3>
			<p>Chloroplasts are only found in plant and algae cells. Photosynthesis happens inside of the chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have their own DNA and 70S ribosomes, like mitochondira. Inside of the chloroplasts there are grana, thylakoids and stroma. A granum (singular of grana) is a stack of thylakoids. Thylakoids are membrane bound sacs that absorb light (the first step in photosynthesis). The stroma is a fluid like substance between the outer membrane and thylakoid membranes, similar to cytosol. There are many essentail enzymes and chemicals for photosynthesis in the stroma.</p>
			<h3>Centrosome</h3>
			<p>The centrosome is usually composed of two centrioles at a right angle to each other. The centrioles form microtubles which act as an anchor point during cell divison, and help with movement and structure. Higher plant cells have the ability to produce microtubules even though they don't have centrioles.</p>
			<h3>Vacuoles</h3>
			<p>Vacuoles are storage containers for the cell. They are formed by the golgi apparatus. Most plant cells have a very large central vacuole and maybe some smaller ones. Animal cells usually just have small vacuoles. Vacuoles can store potential food, metabolic waste, toxins and water. Vacuoles also help increase the surface area to volume ratio, which is good for large cells.</p>

			<h2>Prokaryotic Cells Objective-2.2</h2>
			<p>What is a prokaryotic cell? Prokaryotic cells are one of two classifications of cells, the other being eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are the more simple of the two and are single celled. Prokaryotic cells are less than 1 micrometer in diameter.</p>
			<h3>Identifying the Ultrastructure of Escherichia coli (E. coli)</h3>
			<p>Make sure that you can identify the following parts of a prokaryotic cell:
			  <ul>  <li>the cell wall</li>
			  <li>the plasma membrane</li>
			  <li>flagella</li>
			  <li>ribosomes</li>
			  <li>the nucleoid (the region that contains free DNA)</li></ul></p>
			<img src="images/bio/e_coli.gif" title="E. coli labeled" height="300" width="300" /><p>Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.the-simple-homeschool.com/image-files/prokaryote_cell_.gif">http://www.the-simple-homeschool.com/image-files/prokaryote_cell_.gif</a>. Note: be sure that you can draw and label this daigram (color is not necessary).</p>
			<img src="images/bio/e_coli2.jpg" title="E. coli not labeled (the point is for you to identify the different parts" height="300" width="300" /><p>You will also need to be able to label a diagram similar to the one above. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.buddycom.com/bacteria/gnr/Ecoliplil.jpg">http://www.buddycom.com/bacteria/gnr/Ecoliplil.jpg</a>.</p>
			<h3>Cell Wall and Plasma Membrane</h3>
			<p>Prokaryotic cell walls help keep the shape of the cell and help protect it. The cell walls are composed of a carbohydrate-protein complex known as peptidoglycan. Some bacteria have an additional layer of a polysaccharide outside of the cell wall which gives it the ability to adhere to surfaces like skin, food and teeth. The plasma membrane is just inside of the cell wall and is similar in structure to the plasma membranes in eukaryotic cells. Plasma membranes regulate which substances enter and exit the cell. Plasma membranes also have a role in binary fission. The plasma membrane also holds the cytoplasm of the cell in. Note: the DNA in prokaryotes is "naked" which means that it is directly in the cytoplasm of the cell, which in turn means that all processes of prokaryotes are carried out in the cytoplasm.</p>
			<h3>Pili and Flagella</h3>
			<p>Pili are hair-like growths on the exterior of cells and help with adhesion to various surfaces. There are also specialized pili called "sex pili", their purpose is to transfer genetic material between two cells. Flagella (plural) or flagellum (singular) are used for locomotion (moving around) and are also longer than pili.</p>
			<h3>Ribosomes</h3>
			<p>Ribosomes are sites of protein synthesis (translation to be specific). Basically a mRNA strand comes to a ribosome and subsequent tRNA molecules come and attach a specific amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Ribosomes look like little peieces of sands in electron micrographs (a picture from a microscope).</p>
			<h3>The Nucleoid Region</h3>
			<p>The nucleoid region is the region that genetic material, DNA and plasmids, is located. The DNA is a single circle of DNA that is long and "tangled", the DNA is not organized. There may also be plasmids in the nucleoid region. Plasmids are small DNA molecules that are seperate from the main DNA molecule adn they replecate seperately from the main DNA molecule. Plasmids are not necessary to the everyday survival of the cell but may help the cell adapt when there are changes in the environment.</p>
			<h3>Binary Fission</h3>
			<p>The process of prokaryotes dividing is called binary fission. During binary fission, the DNA is copied, then the two daughter chromosomes (the original DNA and the copy of the original DNA)  become attached to different regions of the cellular membrane, then the cell divides into two identical daughter cells.</p>
			<h3>Overview of Porkaryotes</h3>
			<p>Prokaryotes are/have:
			  <ul><li>"naked" DNA, or DNA without a membrane and is one circular chromosome</li>
			  <li>DNA not attached to proteins</li>
			  <li>lack membrane bound organelles</li>
			  <li>cell wall made up of peptidoglycan</li>
			  <li>usually divide by binary fission</li>
			  <li>usually 1-10 micrometers in size</li></ul></p>

			<p class="post-info">Posted by <a href="index.html">Cole</a> | Filed under: Cell Theory, 2.1</p>

			<h2>Cell Theory Objective-2.1</h2>
			
			<p>There are three main components in cell theory:
			  <ul><li>all organisms are composed of one or more cells</li>
			  <li>cells are the smallest units of life</li>
			  <li>all cells come from pre-existing cells</li></ul></p>
			<h3>Evidence for cell theory</h3>
			<p>The microscope has helped develop and support the cell theory. With the microscope we can see the cells that make up all organisms. Scientists have yet to find an organism that is not made up of one or more cells. Note: viruses are not considered to be living because they can not cary out the functions of life without a host. One experiment by Louis Pasteur (developer of Pasteurization, what milk and other substances go through to kill unwanted organisms) proved that all cells come from pre-existing cells. The experiment that Pasteur performed was that he bioled chicken broth (to kill all of the organisms) and then isolated it. He found that when it was isolated no new organisms appeared but when he opened the chicken broth into the open air organisms appeared.</p>
			<h3>Functions of Life</h3>
			<p>Every organism exists in a multicellular or unicellular form. In order to be classified as an organism, or living, the form must follow the listed criteria:
			  <ul><li>metabolism- the ability to regulate all chemical reactions within an organism</li>
			  <li>growth- the ability to produce new cells</li>
			  <li>reporduction- the ability to create offspring</li>
			  <li>response- the ability to react to the environment around the organism</li>
			  <li>homeostasis- the ability to maintain a stable internal environment</li>
			  <li>nutrition- the ability to provide nutrients to itself and to process said nutrients</li></ul></p>
			<h3>Cells and Sizes</h3>
			<p>Within cells there are various subuits that make them up, called organelles. In order to view individual cells a high resolution microscope is needed. The following list is of relative sizes of substance, which are in decreasing size order: 
			  <ul><li>cells- 100 micrometers</li>
			  <li>organelles- 10 micrometers</li>
			  <li>bacteria- 1 micrometer</li>
			  <li>viruses- 100 nanometers</li>
			  <li>membranes- 10 nanometers</li>
			  <li>molecules- 1 nanometer</li>
			  <li>Note: you will need to know the relative sizes</li></ul></p>
			<p>In order to calculate the size of a specimen seen in a microscope you need to know the diameter of the microscope's field of vision. Then you need to use the formula magnification=(size of image)/(size of specimen) to find the actual size of the specimen. Note: this equation can be modified depending on which variables are know.</p>
			<h3>Limiting Cell Size</h3>
			<p>Why aren't humans just one large cell? Well for one, humans are eukaryotes (or multicellular organisms) and so we have different cells (ex: brain cells, skin cells, etc.). And for two the limiting factor in cell volume is surface area. The reason that surface area limits the volume of cells is because as width increases, volume increases at a much greater rate than surface area. The reason that a cell needs to have an appropriate amount of surface area is because the greater the surface area the more substances that can pass through the cellular membrane. Imagine a very large amusment park, and everyone wants to get into this amusment park but there is only one entrance and people have to enter in single file. The wait for this amusment park would be immense.In this metaphor the amusement park has a large volume but a small "surface area" (the one entrance). The same applies to cells, they need a relatively large surface area compared to volume so that substances can pass in and out easily. The ideal surface area to volume ratio is 4:1 or a cell radius of 1.25 units.</p>
			<h3>Cell Reproduction and Differentiation</h3>
			<p>Reproduction allows for the creation of offspring and to replace old or damaged cells. Most multicellular organisms are initially formed by some sort of sexual reproductionwhich forms a single cell which has the ability to rapidly reproduce and create many different types of cells, also known as an emergent property. Cells in multicellular organisms differentiate in order to create cells that are specialized in one function (ex: brain cells skin cells, etc.). Mulitcellular organisms do this by expressing some genes and not others. Stem cells have the ability to divide and differentiate along different pathways which means that a stem cell could be a heart cell, skin cell, brain cell etc. while a skin cell can only be a skin cell. One theraputic use of stem cells is to transfuse damaged bone marrow into a paitient that has damaged bone marrow due to leukaemia.</p>

			<p class="post-info">Posted by <a href="index.html">Cole</a> | Filed under: Proteins, 7.5</p>
				
			<h2>Proteins Objective-7.5</h2>
			
			<p>There are four organizations of proteins:
			<ul><li>Primary</li>
			<li>Secondary</li>
			<li>Tertiary</li>
			<li>Quaternary</li></ul></p>
			<p>The different types of proteins above are listed from most basic to most complicated. Note: in this context, structure and organization are interchangable.</p>
			<h3>Amino Acids</h3>
			<p>All proteins are made up of amino acids. All amino acids have a central carbon molecule (middle carbon molecule in the picture), a carboxyl group (the right part of the picture with 2 oxygens and a hydrogen), an amine group (the left part of the picture with 2 hydrogens) and a R group (the bottom part of the picture).<img src="images/bio/amino_acid.png" title="amino acid" width="150" height="120" class="float-left" /></a></img>For every amino acid (there are only 20) there is a different R group. Example: the amino acid "alanine" has a R group of CH<sub>3</sub>.

                        <h3>Primary Organization</h3>
                        <p>Primary organization proteins are the most basic of all of the proteins. These types of proteins are just a chain of amino acids held together by peptide bonds (the covalent bond between the carboxyl and amine groups). The order of the amino acids makes the function and the structure of the protien different. <img src="images/bio/primary_protein" title="primary structure protien" width="250" height="200" class="float-left" /></a></img>As the picture to the left shows all of the amino acids are in a line connected by peptide bonds.

                        <h3>Secondary Organization</h3>
			<p>Secondary organization is when bonds form between the oxygen (from the carboxyl group) and the hydrogen (from the amine group) of the amino acids. Note: no bonds are formed between the R groups of the amino acids. There are two common configurations of the secondary structure; &#593;(<strong>alpha, not a</strong>)-helix and &#946;(<strong>beta, not B</strong>)-pleated sheet. Both of these organizations (&#593;-helix and &#946;-pleated sheet) have regular repeating patterns. <img src="images/bio/alpha_helix.gif" title="alpha helix structure" width="200" height="210" class="float-left" /></a></img> <img src="images/bio/beta_sheet.png" title="beta sheet structure" width="220" height="210" class="float-right" /></a></img></p>

                        <h3>Tertiary Organization</h3>
			<p>Tertiary organizaiton is when the polypeptide chain (primary structure protein) bends and bonds with its self. This is different than secondary organizaiton proteins because tertiary structure protiens interact (bond, fold) with the R groups, not just with the amine and carboxyl group. Tertiary organizations have a definite three dimensional structure, as demonstrated in the model. <img src="images/bio/tertiary.gif" title="tertiary structure protein" width="190" height="210" class="float-left" /></a></img> Some interactions that could cause tertiary organization are: 
                        <ul><li>sulfur atoms bonding (covalent bond) to form disulfide bonds, sometimes refered to as bridges due to their strength</li> 
                        <li>hydrogen bonds between polar side chains</li>
			<li>ionic bonds that are formed between positively and negatively charged side chains
			<li>Van der Waals interactions- when a hydrophobic (repelled by water) side chain is forced inward and a hydrophilic (attracted to water) side chain is moved outward due to the presence of water</li></ul>

			<h3>Quaternary Organization</h3>
			<p>The most complex form of protein. These proteins are made up of multiple polypeptide chains (primary structure proteins) folded and bonded together in various places. Some proteins do not have a quaternary structure due to their lack of multiple polypeptide chains (these proteins only consist of one polypeptide chain). Every bond that is mentioned in the previous structures is incorporated into quaternary structure. <img src="images/bio/quaternary.jpg" title="quaternary structure protein" width="210" height="200" class="float-left" /></a></img> Image courtesy of <a href="http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/images/hemoglobin.jpg">http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/images/hemoglobin.jpg</a></p>
                        <h3>Fibrous and Globular Proteins</h3>
			<p>Fibrous proteins:
			  <ul><li>composed of many polypeptide chains and have a long and narrow shape</li>
			  <li>most are insoluable in water</li>
			  <li>example: collagen, a fibrous protein found in the connective tissue of humans</li>
			  <li>example: actin, plays a part in contracting muscles in humans</li></ul></p>
			<p>Globular proteins:
			  <ul><li>three dimensional in shape</li>
			  <li>most are water soluble</li>
			  <li>example: haemoglobin, delivers oxygen to body tissues</li>
			  <li>example: insulin, helps regulate blood glucose levels in humans</li></ul></p>
			<h3>Amino Acids and Polarity</h3>
			<p>The R group is the determinating factor of an amino acid and is therefore an important variable. Amino acids that have a R group that is non-polar are hydrophobic (repels water) and amino acids that have a R group that is polar are hydrophilic (attracts water). Non-polar chains are usually found near the hydrophobic area (middle of the phospholipid bilayer) of the cell membrane while polar chains are usually found near the hydrophilic area (exterior and interior) of the cell membrane. The polar amino acids form integral proteins that make hydrophilic channels for polar substances to pas through the cell membrane.</p>
