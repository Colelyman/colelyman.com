While Paul and Barnabas are teaching in Lystra and Derbe, Paul heals a man that was lame from birth [Acts 14:8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/14.8?lang=eng#9). In my opinion, the interesting part of this story is not that Paul was able to heal a lame man, but the interesting part is what happened after the lame man was healed.


### The Physical and the Spiritual

In many of the miracles that are present in the Bible, there are two aspects of the miracle. These two aspects of the miracle are a physical side, and a spiritual side. When the miracle is associated with healing, there is a physical healing and a spiritual healing.

For example, when Peter healed a man “lame from his mother’s womb” ([Acts 3:2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/3.2?lang=eng#1)) at the temple in Jerusalem there was a physical miracle (the man receiving strength in his legs) as well as a spiritual miracle (the man praising God). This miracle showed those present that it was not the working of Peter, but that he was working through the power of Christ.


### The Missing Element

In the case of Paul healing the man in Lystra, there was only a physical miracle present, no spiritual miracle present. The consequence of this was that the people that witnessed the miracle began to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods ([Acts 14:11](https://lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/14.11?lang=eng#10)).

Furthermore, after the people realized that Paul and Barnabas were not Jupiter and Mercurius, they tried to kill them ([Acts 14:19](https://lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/14.19?lang=eng#18)). It is obvious that the witness of the physical miracle did not have a lasting effect upon the people that saw it.

It is important that we realize that we are here to “walk by faith, not by sight” ([2 Corinthians 5:7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/5.7?lang=eng#6)). We must not only search out the physical miracles in our life, but recognize the spiritual effects of the miracles that occur.
