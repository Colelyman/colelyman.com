Many times in John’s writing of [Revelation](https://lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev) he says the phrase “he that has an ear, let him hear.” This phrase may seem like it is stating the obvious, and could be interpreted as unnecessary literary fluff, but it reality it has deep meaning. Whenever this phrase appears it signals the read to be prepared to interpret what is said next because it is meant to be symbolic.

The phrase itself has an added meaning to me. Almost all of us have ears that can hear, or eyes that can read, but how many of us use them for these purposes? Is God trying to speak with us? If so, are you listening?

If we feel that God isn’t speaking to us or that we aren’t learning from the scriptures, maybe it is that we aren’t hearing. May all of us that have ears hear what we need to hear.
