Yesterday I graduated with my Bachelor's degree from [Brigham Young University](https://byu.edu)
and attended the Convocation services for my college (College of Physical and
Mathematical Sciences). Our dean, [Dr. Shane Reese](https://madison.byu.edu/), gave a very inspirational
talk, of which I would like to share part of it with you.

Dr. Reese's talk centered on two pieces of advice to the graduates, working hard
and being meek. He also provided tools of measurement in order for us to see how
well we are following his advice.

His first piece of advice was to work really hard. He shared that there is no
substitute to working hard, and that one can measure each day if one has given
an honest day's work.

The second piece of advice is what I would like to primarily focus on, and that
advice was to be meek. As a tool to measure one's meekness, he shared a
conversation that he had overheard where a faculty member was discussing the
president of our university, [Dr. Kevin J. Worthen](https://president.byu.edu/bio). This faculty member described
Dr. Worthen as having an incredibly high intelligence to arrogance ratio,
illustrated below.

\\(\frac{intelligence}{arrogance}\\)

Imagine that one's intelligence and arrogance can be quantified, then the
intelligence to arrogance ratio would be your quantified intelligence divided by
your quantified arrogance. For example, if one is incredibly dumb but also quite
full of themselves, then the ratio would be extremely low. On the other hand, if
one is reasonably intelligent while still humble, then the ratio is quite high.
As a third example, if one is intelligent, but also pompous, then the ratio will
be around 1.

In my experience, the individuals with a low ratio are the most pleasant to be
around, because they offer interesting insights and advice while not being
condescending. They are the ones that show you (rather than tell you) how
intelligent they are.

I found this advice to be incredibly insightful and useful to all. I hope to
increase my own intelligence to arrogance ratio as I pursue higher education and
gain more life experience.
