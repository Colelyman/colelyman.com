I love seeing how other people make websites, so if you are anything like me, I hope you find this interesting.

- The site is static and hosted on [Netlify](netlify.com), using their free plan. I have used them for years and have no compliants. Pretty easy to use, and "just works."
- The static site is built using [Middleman](middlemanapp.com), using the [Slim](https://github.com/slim-template/slim) template language. I'm fairly unfamiliar with Ruby, so I have run into issues (mainly with packaging) that would probably be trivial to a more experienced Ruby developer. Overall, I'm very happy with Middleman.
- The site is designed using [Tufte-CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css), which is inspired by [Edward Tufte's](https://www.edwardtufte.com/) books.
- All of the editing is done with The One True Editor, [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
